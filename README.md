# kirby-booking-manager-plugin

Version 1.0.1

A plugin for the [Kirby 2 CMS System](http://getkirby.com) to recieve and manage bookings.

It could be used for hotel room bookings or restauraunt reservations as well as any other, time-related service.

Right now there is only a pre-payment option aviable, but PayPal as well as other integrations are on their way.

If somebody does a booking they get a confirmation Email, as well as you or the assigned contact person gets an information Email, that contains a url to confirm the booking, which will result in another mail to the customer, that gets a final confirmation.

You will need a proper mailserver setup to use the plugin that depends on it to send the confirmation mails.
For local installation e.g. xampp you can use this guide: http://stackoverflow.com/a/18185233
